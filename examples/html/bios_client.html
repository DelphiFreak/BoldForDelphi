    <a href="../Delphi/Compound/Bios/Client.dpr">Launch Delphi-example</a>
    <p>This example of how to use the COM based components in $(PRODUCT_BASE_NAME) is based on the
    classic example of Buildings and owners. Some parts have been reused completely unmodified, some
    parts ported using the Clientifier tool, and some parts are new for the example.
    </p>
    <p class="note"><b>NOTE!</b> To run this example, you must register two DLLs that ship with
    $(PRODUCT_BASE_NAME) (BoldComObjectSpace.dll and BoldComConnection.dll). They contain the
    typelibraries to use the com-support in $(PRODUCT_BASE_NAME). You must also register the TLB-file
    that is in the bios/core catalog (BuildingsAndOwners.tlb)
    </p>
    <hr size="1">
    
    <p class="head2">How to register the dll's</p>
    <p>To do the registration, use the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>regsvr32.exe<br>
        &quot;c:\program files\BoldSoft\&lt;installation dir&gt;\bin\BoldComObjectSpace.dll&quot;
      <li>regsvr32.exe<br>
        &quot;c:\program files\BoldSoft\&lt;installationdir&gt;\bin\BoldComConnection.dll&quot;
      <li> BuildingsAndOwners.tlb<br>
        &quot;c:\program files\Borland\DelphiX\bin\tregsvt.exe&quot;
    </ul>
<p class="head2">Clientify the model</p>
    First of all, the original GUI unit (and the new renderer unit which collects all the renderers of the
    old example on a single datamodule) was converted using the clientifier program, and stored in the
    directory ClientGui. The Clientifier will change all Bold aware components into their COM equivalents
    (TBoldEdit -&gt; TBoldEditCom etc). It will also change a number of type references into the COM
    equivalents (TBoldElement -&gt; IBoldElement, TBoldObject -&gt; IBoldObject etc). It will modify the
    uses statement of the units to include the correct units with the COM declarations. We also loaded the
    UML-model into the clientifier and got references to the business layer converted (TPerson -&gt; IPerson etc).
    <p>Then we added a datamodule to handle the connection to the server, Client\DMClient, with the following components:
    </p>
<ul>
  <li>BoldComConnectionHandle1 - The client side gateway to handle all communication with the
    server:<br><br>ServerCLSID = the same guid as is found in the ServerCode.pas unit</li>
  <li>SystemHandle - The COM client of the SystemHandle found on DMCore in the server:<br><br>
    ConnectionHandle = BoldComConnectionHandle1 - specifies the gateway to use when talking to the server.<br>
    ObjectName = System - The objectname of the ServerElementHandle to connect to on the server.</li>
</ul>
	<p>Now, the components on ClientGui\MainForm.pas can be connected to the SystemHandle of Client\DMClient.
	Some uses statements has to be manually corrected, this could be avoided if the datamodule of the
    client had the same name as the original datamodule with the TBoldSystemHandle (ie DMCore).
    </p>
<p class="head2">Code modifications</p>
    <p>The program needs some further manual changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objects can not be created using <code>TPerson.Create(nil)</code>
    any more since there is no TPerson on the Client, and interfaces (IPerson) doesn't have constructors.
    Instead we must call a method on IBoldSystem (Delete still works as usual though):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <code>DMClientSystem.SystemHandle.System.CreateNewObject('Person', True );</code></li>
  <li>TBoldSystemHandleCom.Active is not the same as TBoldSystemHandle.Active. Active on the client system
    handle refers to whether the handle is connected or not, whereas Active on the normal system handle
    means whether there is a system with objects or not. The property on the client system handle that
    corresponds to the Active property on the normal system handle is called SystemActive.</li>
  <li>The Client can not activate or deactivate the system handle on the server.</li>
  <li>Autoforms are not yet supported on the client side.</li>
  <li>The equivalent of &quot;<font face="Courier New">is</font>&quot; on interfaces is called
    <font face="Courier New">QueryInterface</font>:<br>
   <code><b>if</b> element <b>is</b> TPerson <b>then</b> -&gt; <b>if</b>
    element.QueryInterface(IPerson, result) = S_OK <b>then</b></code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="close">&quot;<font face="Courier New">as</font>&quot; can be used as usual with interfaces and works like
    an implicit QueryInterface with no checking of the result.</li>
  <li>The &quot;M_&quot;-properties are not exposed in the COM-interfaces, subscription must be done by
    calling SubscribeToExpression on the business objects.</li>
  <li>Filters and comparers are not supported on the client side (but listhandles on the server side can
    have filters and sorters and be exposed with a name to the client).</li>
  <li>There is no locking mechanism of attributes from the clients (ie HoldsChangedValue,
    ReleaseChangedValue, ObservermayModify).</li>
</ul>

<p class="head3">Placing of subscriptions</p>
<p>

  Placing subscriptions looks a little bit different on the client side that we are used to.
    The signature for <code>IBoldElement.SubscribeToExpression</code> looks like this:
    <code>procedure SubscribeToExpression(const Expression: WideString;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;const ClientId: WideString;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;SubscriberId: Integer;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Resubscribe: WordBool;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;CancelOld: WordBool);</code>
 	<br>
    <br>The expression is what we are used to, an OCL expression that we want to subscribe to. The
    ClientId identifies the client placing the subscription, and the SubscriberID identifies the
    subscriber. All subscribers on the clientside will be of the class TBoldComClientSubscriber, and
    fortunately, this has the properties ClientId and SubscriberID which satisfies our purposes.
    <br>The Resubscribe parameter is the same as for normal subscriptions, Force the requested event
    breResubscribe for all subscriptions that are placed.
    <br>CancelOld is a shortcut to reduce the number of network calls. instead of calling
    CancelAllSubscriptions and then call SubscribeToExpression, the CancelOld parameter can be sent as
    true. Otherwise it should always be false.
