<p>A derived attribute is a value that does not need to be persistent since it can always be
    calculated using other values. Examples of derived attributes are the total sum of
    an invoice, the full name of a person or the age of a person given the birth
date. For many
    derived attributes it would not make sense to try to reverse the procedure of deriving as is
    the case for the total sum of an invoice. What would it mean to increase the total sum?
How would you apply it to the invoice items?<p>For other derived attributes the reversing of its value is quite straight forward. Consider the
age/birth date, it's quite obvious how to update the age if the birthday
    changes and vice versa.

   	<p class="head2">How to run</p>
   	<p>Follow these steps to try out the example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add a person to the grid using the navigator. Enter a full name for the person in the
	fullName-column using the format [<i>firstname lastname</i>]. 
	Leave the column and you will see how the full name is separated into firstname and lastname. 
	The lastname is stored as a familyname in a related family object (class <code>TFamily</code>).</li>
  <li>Add a new person and enter a full name with the <b>same</b> lastname as the first
	person you added. Leave the column. The name is split in firstname and lastname
	as above but as a family object with that familyname already exists a new family
	object isn't created.</li>
  <li>Change the lastname in the fullName-column for one of
	the persons and see what happens with the family object. If more than one person
	exists within the family a new family object is created with the new
    familyname. If there's only one
	person existing in the family the familyname is updated according to the change
	of the fullname for that person.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="head2">Reverse derive</p>
	<p>Whenever the full name changes, the method <code>TPerson._fullName_ReverseDerive</code> is executed, and we
    must handle what it means to have changed the name to something new. In this case, the
    familyname is stored in a related object (the <code>TFamily</code>), so we will have to manipulate not only
    attribute values, but also creation and deletion of objects, and setting of links.
    </p>
    <p>We have also implemented a reverse derived attribute for the class <code>TFont</code> called noValues. The
    <code>TFont</code> has 3 style-properties (bold, underline, and blink), setting any of these will clear the
    noValues, and setting the noValues will clear all three style-properties. The noValues can
    however not be &quot;unset&quot; (except by setting a style-property).
