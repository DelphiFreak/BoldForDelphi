    <p>Conway's Game of Life is a small &quot;machine&quot; or cell automata, that develops
    according to some simple rules. Each cell on the grid may be active or inactive. Between
    generations, the following might happen:
    <ul>
      <li>A cell dies. If the cell has more than 3 neighbours, it dies of overcrowding.
        If it has fewer than 2 neighbours it dies of isolation.</li>
      <li>A cell survives. If the cell has 2 or 3 neighbours, it survives.</li>
      <li>A cell is born. If a cell on the grid has *exactly* three neighbours, it will be
        active in the next generation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The example implementation uses a lot of derivations, both for
    associations and attributes.
    There is also a qualified association in there. There is surprisingly little code.
    <p>The game is modelled as one &quot;game&quot; with two associations to &quot;cell&quot;.
    One of these associations (coord) is qualified on x, y. The cells have derived
    associations to
    their neighbouring cells and a derived attribute for number of active neighbours.
	<p>The representation, board, is a reverse derived string (BLOB) attribute on game. The derivation is two
    way, changing it changes the cells.
    <p>If you want to learn more about the Game of Life, there is plenty of information on
    the Internet, like
    <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~callahan/lifepage.html" target="_blank">Paul's Page of
    Conway's Life Miscellany</a>.&nbsp;
	<p class="head2">Derive associations</p>
	<p>To see an example of one of the derived associations in this example open the
	model editor. Select the role <code>cDown</code> in the
    <code>Cell</code> class (association named <code>Vertical</code>). If you can't see an editfield named <code>Derivation OCL</code> go to the main menu and check the
	Advanced option under View. Now you should get
	additional fields and one of them should be the <code>Derivation OCL</code>
	field. There you can see the OCL expression that is used to derive the value
	of this role.
