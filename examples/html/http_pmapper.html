    <p>This example shows how to use the HTTP persistence mapping components in
    $(PRODUCT_BASE_NAME). It is based on the classic example of Buildings and owners.
    It consists of a client and a server. The UML model used in the application
    is the Buildings and Owners model. The client application has a GUI
    identical to the BldOwn example. Whereas in the Building and Owners example
    the UI layer, business objects' layer and persistence layer all reside in
    the same physical location (i.e. application), in this example the UI and
    business objects' layer reside in the client application and the persistence
    layer resides in the server application. The server application consists of
    an ISAPI dll, and the client communicates with it over HTTP.
    <h3>Running the example</h3>
    <h4>Generating the database and setting remote interbase</h4>
<p>To be able run the example you must first run <font face="Courier New">DBGen.exe</font>
(located in the DBGenerator directory) and use the 'Create Database' button to
generate an interbase database (<font face="Courier New">\HTTPPMapper\DBGenerator\httpPMapper.gdb</font>)
and create a BDE alias for it named <font face="Courier New">HTTPPMapper</font>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very important to remember that in order to allow our server, which
consists of an ISAPI dll, to connect to this Interbase database we <b>MUST</b>
use <b>REMOTE</b> interbase. For&nbsp; this you must edit the <font face="Courier New">HTTPPMapper</font>
 alias configuration and modify the Server name so that the path is preceded by
the machine name where the database is located:</p>
    <p class="code">localhost:C:\Work\BfD\Examples\Compound\HTTPPMapper\DBGenerator\HTTPPMAPPER.GDB
    <h4>Installing the server</h4>
    <p>As mentioned earlier the server (<font face="Courier New">BoldHTTPServer.exe</font>)
    consists of an ISAPI dll and hence to be able to use it you must first
    intall it in IIS (for more details refer to the appendix in the
    <a href="xmldispatcher.htm">XMLDispatcher example documentation</a>).&nbsp;
    <p>The example assumes that your default web site (IIS) contains a virtual
    directory with alias name 'Bold' and local path <font face="Courier New">'C:\Work\BFD\examples\Delphi\Compound\HTTPPMapper\HTTPServerDll</font>'. You should
    then be able
    to browse it (the local path) using the url '<font face="Courier New">http://localhost/Bold</font>'.
    If you chose to have another alias name or place the server in some other
    location, remember to change the url property of the <i> BoldWebConnection1</i>
    component in the DataModUnit unit of the HTTPClient application.&nbsp;
    <h4>Running the client</h4>
<p>Run the <font face="Courier New">HTTPClient</font>, use the '<font face="Courier New">Open
System</font>' button to connect to the server. Right click in the persons' grid
or the buildings' grid to display the pop up menus for creating/deleting
objects.&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>A word about security</h4>
<p>If you haven't configured the security settings for your ISAPI dll or virtual
directory properly,&nbsp; you might encounter problems when trying to open the
system (from the client). If you get a message saying
'TBoldPersistenceControllerDefault.PMFetchIdListWithCondition: not Active' then
you can be certain that you have some security issues, the server was not able
to connect to the database because it did not have enough rights. A tip would be
to check the Identity under which the server dll is run (Component Services). If
you're a beginner with IIS it's usually a good idea to set the identity to the <font face="Courier New">&lt;LocalMachine&gt;\IWAM_&lt;LocalMachine&gt;</font>
user account that's created by IIS and make sure you set a password for it.
<p class="note"><b>NOTE!</b> The HTTP PMapping components are documented in the
Reference Guide.
    <h3>BoldHTTPServer</h3>
    The important points to note in the server are:
    <ul>
      <li>The server does not need a system.</li>
      <li>The server needs a persistence mapper:<br>
        BoldPersistenceHandleBDE1,
        connected to the <font face="Courier New">HTTPPMapper</font> interbase alias.</li>
      <li>The server and the client should use the same model (not necessarily
        the same model component). In this case they use the same model component
        located in the unit <i> dmCoreUnit.pas</i> (in \HTTP_PMapper\Client): BoldModel1.</li>
      <li>The server uses a TWebModule component to handle web connections:<br>
        WebModule1 in <i>MainUnit.pas</i>.</li>
      <li>The server uses a BoldHTTPPersistenceHandlePassthrough component:<br>
        httpPMapper. The BoldHTTPPersistenceHandlePassthrough is used to interpret the
        request data in SOAP format and interpret it. It then uses a real persistence
        handle to handle persistency. Properties:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/grey_dot.gif" width="5" height="5"> "PersistenceHandle: for
        connecting the passthrough handle to the BDE<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persistence handle BoldPersistenceHandleBDE1.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/grey_dot.gif" width="5" height="5"> BoldModel: dmCore.BoldModel1.</li>
      <li>A WebActionItem is defined: PMapper, with its <i> pathInfo</i> property set to
        '/BuildingsAndOwners'.
        In the OnAction event handler of this action item a call is made to the Get
        method of httpPMapper. The first argument passed to this method is the content of
        the Request (received from the web server); the second argument that should be
        passed is an out parameter that will hold the reply that should be returned back
        to the web server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note"><b>Note!</b> all data flowing between the client and the server are in SOAP format.
    <h3>HTTPClient</h3>
    The <font face="Courier New">HTTPClient</font> is almost identical to the Buildings
    and Owners example, except that it does not directly connect to a persistence storage,
    but instead to a web server: BoldHTTPServer, which handles the persistence mapping.
    <p>The important components used by the client are (unit <i>DataModUnit.pas</i>):
    <ul>
      <li>BoldWebConnection1: handles the connection with the web server. Properties:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/grey_dot.gif" width="5" height="5"> Url: this corresponds to the URL of the PMapper web action item defined in the
        BoldHTTPServer. Value is set to <font face="Courier New">http://localhost/Bold/BoldHTTPServer.dll/BuildingsAndOwners</font>
      </li>
      <li>BoldHTTPClientPersistenceHandle1:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/grey_dot.gif" width="5" height="5"> BoldModel: dmCore.BoldModel1<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/grey_dot.gif" width="5" height="5"> WebConnection: BoldWebConnection1</li>
    </ul>
