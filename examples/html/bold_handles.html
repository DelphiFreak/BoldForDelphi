    This is a brief description of the different types of handles available in Bold. For each
    handle there is also one or more links to examples using the handle.
    <p>The handles are nonvisual components. The various types of handles are the developers
    primary interface to the elements of an objectspace.
    <p>The handles have a value which is a TBoldElement. TBoldElement is a superclass of all
    parts or the objects representation in the ObjectsSpace. In most cases the value will be
    a domain object (e.g. a TPerson).
    <p>The Bold-aware visual controls are then in turn connected to handles. The handles can
    be divided into two basic groups, the root handles, and the rooted handles.
    <h3>Root handles</h3>
    Root handles either own or refer to an element.
    <h4>BoldSystemHandle</h4>
    The owner of an entire object system. Most applications will have only one system handle.<br>
    The TBoldSystemHandle is used in all examples.
    <h4>BoldReferenceHandle</h4>
    A handle that can be set to point at any element. It is often used as the first
    handle on a form showing e.g a single person.<br>
    See examples: <a href="treeview.html">TreeView</a> and <a href="multilanguage.html">MultiLanguage</a>
    <h4>BoldVariableHandle</h4>
    A handle that owns an element which is not an object e.g. a string, or a list of
    persons. The handle acts as a placeable variable which can be connected to controls,
    and used in variable definitions. The handle can also be used as a placeable constant
    through the use of InitialValues.<br>
    See examples: <a href="combobox.html">ComboBox</a> and <a href="derived_handle.html">Derived Handle</a>
    <h4>BoldSQLHandle</h4>
    A handle that uses the database for SQL searches. Its value is a list of objects
    resulting from the search. It is often used as the first handle on a form showing a
    list resulting from a search.<br>
    See example: <a href="sql_handle.html">SQL Handle</a>
    <h3>Rooted handles</h3>
    Rooted handles derive their value from another handle. Rooted handles can be connected to
    each other, allowing chained evaluation.
    <h4>BoldExpressionHandle</h4>
    Derives its value by applying an OCL-expression to the value of its root.<br>
    See example: <a href="treeview.html">TreeView</a>
    <h4>BoldCursorHandle</h4>
    Takes the value of its root, and interprets it as a list. It holds a CurrentIndex,
    and has a value which is the current index of the list. It has two properties that,
    in a sense, are the value of the handle List, which is the list, and Value which is
    the current element in the list. Multi-value controls such as grids, or the dropdown
    of a combobox will display the List, while single-value controls, and rooted handes
    will use the current element (the value property).<br>
    See examples: <a href="combobox.html">ComboBox</a> and <a href="derived_handle.html">Derived Handle</a>
    <h4>BoldListHandle</h4>
    This is the handle first encountered by most developers. It actually has a complex
    internal structure, extending a TBoldCursorHandle, containing an expressionhandle
    and (optionally) sorters and filters. Like the TBoldCursorHandle is has List and
    Value properties. It is often used for displaying an entire class (when connected to
    a TBoldSystemHandle), or for following n-valued associations (when connected to
    another handle who's value is an object).<br>
    The TBoldListHandle is used in all examples.
    <h4>BoldDerivedHandle</h4>
    Allows completely custom derivation of its value through user written code in
    an event-handler.<br>
    See example: <a href="derived_handle.html">Derived Handle</a>
