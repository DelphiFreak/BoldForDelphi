    <p>This example shows of some of the features included in the BoldTreeView control.
    <p>The following features are included in the example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a simple treeview with node branches and leafs that corresponds
        to objects in the persistence layer.</li>
      <li>Build simple treeview with &quot;fake&quot; node branches that don't
        corresponds to objects in the persistence layer with leafs that do.</li>
    </ul>
	<hr size="1">
	<p class="head2">How to run</p>
<p>Check the model, either the rose-model or in the model editor (double click
the <code>TBoldModel</code> control on the form). The model of this example
contains of three classes, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Department&quot; and
&quot;Employee&quot;. The relations between them are:
	</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <em>Company</em> consists of several <em>Departments</em>
  <li>Each <em>Department</em> employs several <em>Employees</em>
  <li>A <em>Department</em> only belongs to one <em>Company</em>
  <li>An <em>Employee</em> is employed only by one <em>Department</em>
  <li>Each <em>Employee</em> also belongs to a <em>Company</em> since the <em>Department</em>
    belongs to a <em>Company</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Run the application. In the main form there are two treeview controls (the
big white space that is empty before you have entered any data to the
objectspace) and three grids. In the grids you enter companies, departments and
employees.&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>Start by entering one company and add some departments to it. For each
department add some employees. As you can see the two treeviews will be updated
with the objects you enter.&nbsp;
	</p>
<p> In the right treeview the selected companys departments
will be listed as node branches and each departments employees will be listed as
node
leafs. The structure follows the structure in the model. Each employee is listed
under its employer (department).&nbsp;
	</p>
<p>In the left treeview the structure of the model is broken. In this treeview
we will list all the employees of each department of the selected company in
alphabetical order taking no consideration of the departments. To do this we
create &quot;fake&quot; node branches and with the help of OCL expressions we
list the employers under the right node branch according to the employees last
name.

    <p class="note"><b>Note!</b> Please make sure to use the &quot;Create DB &amp; Alias&quot;
    button before attempting to open the system for the first time. Once the database and alias is
    established you only have to use the &quot;Open system&quot; button when running the example
    program.
